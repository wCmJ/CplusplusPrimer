memory is not the only kind of resource that can leak.
Files, locks, network connections, and threads are examples of system resources that a function may have to release or hand over to an object before throwing an exception.

Exception-Safe Implementation Techniques:
1. try-block
2. resource acquisition is initialization RAII(the object destructor will be invoked whether that destruction is caused by normal exit from its scope or from an exception)
